# Printf

# Description
This is a collaboration project for the ALX SE program to write our own print function independent of the inbuilt function from the language's standard library. 

In this project, we define our own MACROS and conversion specifiers. 

# Usage
How to use this function:

All the files are to be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Compile the code with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
Include the "main.h" header file on the functions using the _printf()
